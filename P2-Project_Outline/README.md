# Project Overview
This project is an application for plant owners to keep track of their plants and those plants' watering schedule. Users will create a personal account with a username and password. Once an account has been created, users have the option to "add a plant" (and delete a plant)one by one until they have represented their entire garden. When a user adds their plant, they will include the plant's name, a picture of the plant, and that specific plant's watering schedule. 
After all plants have been created, the user can view all plants in their "my garden" section. Users can click a checkbox under the watering schedule to keep track of that plant's watering. 
# Features
1. User Login= User can create accounts and log into their garden with username and password validation. Different parts of the app will only be accessible to those with accounts. Each user will have a garden section specific to them.
2. Add plants= The user will have the option to add plants to their garden. When a user adds a plant, they will include the plant's name, watering schedule, and a picture of the plant. Possibly the user could add multiple pictures to show growth or sections to update the size.
3. Delete Plants= If our app has failed and a plant dies or leaves the garden for some reason, the user can delete the plant from their garden.
4. Track plant watering= The user will have the ability to check a box next to the day of the week to track a plant's watering. The checkboxes will reset at the start of a new week.
